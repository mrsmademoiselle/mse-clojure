# CLOJURE

A small project for my university module "modern software development". 
The end goal was to re-create your previously developed minigame (https://github.com/mrsmademoiselle/mse-rock-paper-scissor) in functional programming.

  <summary>Peak assignment</summary>
  Develop a small program/game, possibly analogous to the CCD task, in Clojure or another excellent functional language! Porting of the CCD game is particularly welcome. Please avoid embellishments such as GUI, etc.
  
  Attempt to write the program completely stateless (possibly only with finals), depending on the language.
  
  The goal here is not to learn a language completely, but to explore a few basic concepts such as statelessness or higher-order functions! Therefore, limit the functionality to avoid making it too extensive.
